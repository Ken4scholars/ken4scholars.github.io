## About Me

I am a software engineer and programming mentor. I graduated from <a href="https://university.innopolis.ru/" target="_blank">Innopolis University</a>, Russian Federation with a major in Computer Science.
I have experience working with companies across different fields and technology stacks ranging from development of scalable APIs to distributed GIS infrastructure.
My major interests include Backend Development, Machine Learning/Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.
The technologies I have used in the course of my work and study include Python, Java, Scala, Django, Scikit Learn, Keras, etc.
Here I sometimes talk about tech, my work and life in general. You're welcome to my little world :)
